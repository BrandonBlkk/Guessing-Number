# Number Guessing Game

This simple Python script is a number guessing game where the user needs to guess a randomly generated number. The project is useful for providing a basic interactive experience for users and demonstrates the use of conditional statements, loops, and basic input validation in Python.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrandonBlkk/Guessing-Number.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Guessing-Number
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python NumberGuessing.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input a positive integer as the maximum range for the randomly generated number.

5. Make guesses by entering numeric values when prompted.

6. The game will provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too low, or too high.

7. Continue making guesses until you correctly guess the random number.

8. The game will display the number of guesses it took to find the correct answer.
